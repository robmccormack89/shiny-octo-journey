<p>Mlouyeâ€™s founder and creative director Meb Rure hails from an industrial design background. In 2015, Meb decided to change gears and turn her energy towards Mlouye, a collection of exceptional handbags. Focusing on quality material, good design, craftsmanship and sustainability.</p>

<p>Meb was highly inspired by Bauhaus Movement's artists and architects. From Mies Van der Rohe works to Kandinsky's paintings, to Aalto' furniture, she acquired a rationalist vision of design by gleaning how they served a utilitarian purpose in a cleverly simple way. Mlouye merges industrial design and fashion, creating functional handbags made of luxurious and honest materials to improve people's lives in small but important ways.</p>

<p>Innovation being the key factor alongside aesthetic, Mlouye has brought unexpected shapes with smart details, functionality and a new luxury feel with a contemporary price point. Istanbul is where Mlouye was born, the company's headquarters is now split between the United States and Turkey.</p>
